# AFK-Simmumah-Macro
For Destiny 2's Ghosts of the Deep Dungeon

Prerequisites:

Simmumah Checkpoint.

Witherhoard.

A friend to revive you.

An energy weapon with primary ammo in the 1st slot.

An energy weapon with special ammo equipped.

How does the Simmumah Cheese work?

If you shoot a witherhoard at Simmumah then die, it'll do damage against Simmumah as long as the Damage over time is refreshed by shooting another Witherhoard shot at Simmumah before the 10 second Witherhoard shot timer.
If you have no heavy ammo, no special ammo in your energy slot, and have 12 or less Witherhoard ammo, the game will start a 30 second timer. If the criteria is met, the game will give you 5 witherhoard ammo and like 1/4 of the max amount of special ammo your energy weapon can hold.
To continue recieving ammo magically, you'll need to empty your energy special weapon to 0.

How does the Macro work?

The macro will shoot the Witherhoard every 8 seconds
After 4 witherhoard shots, 8 seconds each, the macro will swap your energy weapon with the first weapon in the energy slot inventory, then swap back to the previously equipped special weapon.
The macro will then continue looping until the macro has been stopped or reloaded.

Why does the Macro work?
In order to automate this, the problems that needed to be solved is being able to shoot the witherhoard at Simmumah with 100% consistency. Sometimes Simmumah will float up and down making consistent shots from a far away distance inconsistent. 
Therefore, this is solved by standing directly underneath Simmumah and looking completely up until there is no more. This has the added benefit of no recoil because we are looking perfectly up.

We need the special energy weapon to have 0 ammo to continue recieving magic ammo. If we just shot the ammo out of the special ammo, I would need to take into consideration recoil. By swapping the special weapon to a weapon that takes primary ammo then back to the special ammo, we will no longer have special ammo. 
So now we can start to recieve magic ammo again.

Line yourself up for where the Witherhoard reticle lines line up with Simmumah.

How to get the cheese done faster?
Apply the Strand Warlock charged melee with your first Witherhoard shot before you die. This will apply Sever and have strand things do damage alongside the Witherhoard.
Have other fireteam members apply a debuff to Simmumah using Tractor Cannon, Tether, Void Hunter Smoke, Void Hunter Quickfall, or other debuffs.
Have other fireteam members apply a buff to you using Boots of the Assembler to give you Blessing of the Sky, Generate Orbs of Power so you can have Kinetic Weapon Surge, or other player buffs.

Only Witherhoard can take 10 minutes on normal, 20-25 min on Master.
With debuffs and buffs, it can be reduced to 6-7 min on normal, 8-10 min on Master.

Future ideas:
Have the macro use commands from an emulated controller, so that the user can Alt-Tab out and continue using their PC.
